For runtime data exchange and coupling with other kernels, the Julia kernel is wrapped in a Python API (ribasim_api) which implements the Basic Modelling Interface BMI.\nThe Ribasim QGIS plugin allows users to view or edit a model without programming. For specific tasks, like adding long timeseries, using Python is strongly recommended.\nOne can also use Ribasim Python to build entire models from base data, such that your model setup is fully reproducible.\n\n\n2 Download\n\nRibasim executable - Windows: ribasim_windows.zip\nRibasim executable - Linux: ribasim_linux.zip\nQGIS plugin: ribasim_qgis.zip.\nGenerated testmodels: generated_testmodels.zip\n\nThe Ribasim Python package is registered in PyPI and conda-forge and can therefore be installed with pip, conda or pixi:\npip install ribasim\n\n\n3 Ribasim core\nRibasim is typically used as a command-line interface (CLI). It is distributed as a .zip archive, that must be downloaded and unpacked. It can be placed anywhere, however it is important that the contents of the zip file are kept together in a directory. The Ribasim CLI executable is in the bin directory.\nTo check whether the installation was performed successfully, run ribasim with no arguments in the command line. This will give the following message:\nUsage: ribasim 'path/to/model/ribasim.toml'\n\n\n4 Ribasim Python\nThe Ribasim Python package (named ribasim) aims to make it easy to build, update and analyze Ribasim models programmatically.\nThe Ribasim QGIS plugin allows users to construct a model from scratch without programming. For specific tasks, like adding observed rainfall timeseries, it can be faster to use Python instead.\nOne can also use Ribasim Python to build entire models from base data, such that your model setup is fully reproducible.\nThe package is registered in PyPI and can therefore be installed with pip:\npip install ribasim\nFor documentation please see the examples and API reference.",

In a physical interpretation, evaporation is switched on or off per individual droplet of water. In general, the effect of the reduction term is negligible, or not even necessary. As a surface water dries, its wetted area decreases and so does the evaporative flux.

Firstly there is the average over the last allocation interval \\(\\Delta t_{\\text{alloc}}\\) of the vertical fluxes (precipitation, evaporation, infiltration and drainage) for each basin: \\[\n    \\phi_i(t) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_{\\text{alloc}}}\\int_{t - \\Delta t_{\\text{alloc}}}^t \\left[Q_{P,i}(t') - Q_{E,i}(t') + Q_{\\text{drn},i}(t') - Q_{\\text{inf},i}(t') \\right] dt', \\quad \\forall i \\in B_S.\n\\]\nWe consider fluxes into the basin to be positive and out of the basin to be negative. For more information see the natural water balance terms.\nSecondly, there is either a supply or demand from the storage in the basin. Given a minimum level \\(\\ell_{\\min, i}\\) and a maximum level \\(\\ell_{\\max, i}\\) which correspond to a minimum storage \\(s_{\\min, i}\\) and maximum storage \\(s_{\\max, i}\\) respectively, we get a flow supply of \\[\n    F^{\\text{basin out}}_{\\max, i} = \\max\\left(0.0, \\frac{u_i(t)-s_{\\max,i}}{\\Delta t_{\\text{alloc}}} + \\phi_i(t)\\right)\n\\]\nand a demand of \\[\n    d^p_i = \\max\\left(0.0, \\frac{s_{\\min,i} - u_i(t)}{\\Delta t_{\\text{alloc}}} - \\phi_i(t)\\right),\n\\]\nfor all \\(i \\in B_S\\).

If flows are not too large with respect to basin storage, this will prevent basins from reaching 0. Rather, the basin gets a very small storage. The reduction factors help with performance, but are also an important tool to avoid getting negative storage in basins. Negative storage needs to be avoided since it is not a real solution, and would introduce water into the model that doesn’t exist. Another tool used to avoid negative storage is the isoutoutofdomain option, which Ribasim makes use of. This rejects timesteps that lead to negative storage, instead retrying with a smaller timestep.",

    "text": "In this section we give a formal description of the problem that is solved by Ribasim. The problem is of the form\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{d}\\mathbf{u}}{\\text{d}t} = f(\\mathbf{u},p(t),t),\\quad t \\in [t_0,t_\\text{end}],\n\\]\ni.e. a system of coupled first order ordinary differential equations, with initial condition \\(\\mathbf{u}(t_0)= \\mathbf{u}_0\\) and time dependent input data denoted by \\(p(t)\\).\nThe model is given by a directed graph, consisting of a set of nodes (or vertices) \\(V\\) and edges \\(E\\). Let \\(V\\) be the set of node IDs and let \\(E\\) be the set of ordered tuples \\((i,j)\\) meaning that node \\(i\\) is connected to node \\(j\\).\nWe can split the set of nodes into two subsets \\(V = B \\cup N\\), where \\(B\\) is the set of basins and \\(N\\) is the set of non-basins. The basins have an associated storage state and the non-basins dictate how water flows to or from basins.\n\\(\\mathbf{u}(t)\\) is given by all the states of the model, which are (currently) the storage of the basins and the integral terms of the PID controllers, the latter being explained in PID equations.\nGiven a single basin with node ID \\(i \\in B\\), the equation that dictates the change of its storage over time is given by\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{d}u_i}{\\text{d}t} =\n\\sum_{(i',j') \\in E | j' = i} Q_{i',j'} - \\sum_{(i',j') \\in E | i' = i} Q_{i',j'} + F_i(p,t).\n\\]\nHere \\(Q_{i,j}\\) is the flow along an edge, where the graph direction dictates positive flow. So the first term denotes flow towards the basin, the second one denotes flow away from the basin, and the third term denotes external forcing. \\(F_i(p,t)\\) is given by input data, and \\(Q_{i' ,j'}\\) is determined by the type of nodes that connect to that edge.\nThe various node and forcing types that the model can contain are explained in the section Natural water balance terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn general a model has more nodes than states, so in the Julia core there is a distinction between node indices and state indices. For simplicity these are treated as equal in the documentation when it comes to basins and their storage.\n\n\n\n\nThe Jacobian is a \\(n\\times n\\) matrix where \\(n\\) is the number of states in the simulation. The Jacobian is computed either using finite difference methods or automatic differentiation. For more details on the computation of the Jacobian and how it is used in the solvers see numerical considerations.\nThe entries of the Jacobian \\(J\\) are given by \\[\nJ[i,j] = \\frac{\\partial f_j}{\\partial u_i},\n\\]\nhence \\(J[i,j]\\) quantifies how \\(f_j\\), the derivative of state \\(j\\) with respect to time, changes with a change in state \\(i\\). If a node creates dependendies between basin storages (or other states), then this yields contributions to the Jacobian. If \\(j\\) corresponds to a storage state, then\n\\[\nJ[i,j] = \\sum_{(i',j') \\in E | j' = i} \\frac{\\partial Q_{i',j'}}{\\partial u_i} - \\sum_{(i',j') \\in E | i' = i} \\frac{\\partial Q_{i',j'}}{\\partial u_i},\n\\]\nMost of these terms are always \\(0\\), because a flow over an edge only depends on a small number of states. Therefore the matrix \\(J\\) is very sparse.\nFor many contributions to the Jacobian the derivative of the level \\(l(u)\\) of a basin with respect to its storage \\(u\\) is required. To get an expression for this, we first look at the storage as a function of the level:\n\\[\nu(l) = \\int_{l_0}^l A(\\ell)d\\ell.\n\\]\nFrom this we obtain \\(u'(l) = A(l)\\) and thus \\[\n\\frac{\\text{d}l}{\\text{d}u} = \\frac{1}{A(u)}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe presence of division by the basin area means that areas of size zero are not allowed.",

These two pumps together behave like a reversible pump. When pumping can be done in only one direction, and the other direction is only possible under gravity, use an Outlet for that direction.\nSetup the basins:\n\nmodel = Model(starttime=\"2020-01-01\", endtime=\"2021-01-01\", crs=\"EPSG:4326\")\n\n\nmodel.basin.add(\n    Node(1, Point(0.0, 0.0)),\n    [\n        basin.Profile(area=[1000.0, 1000.0], level=[0.0, 1.0]),\n        basin.State(level=[20.0]),\n        basin.Time(time=[\"2020-01-01\", \"2020-07-01\"], precipitation=[0.0, 3e-6]),\n    ],\n)\n\nSetup the discrete control:\n\nmodel.discrete_control.add(\n    Node(7, Point(1.0, 0.0)),\n    [\n        discrete_control.Variable(\n            compound_variable_id=1,\n            listen_node_id=1,\n            listen_node_type=[\"Basin\"],\n            variable=[\"level\"],\n        ),\n        discrete_control.Condition(\n            compound_variable_id=1,\n            # min, max\n            greater_than=[5.0, 15.0],\n        ),\n        discrete_control.Logic(\n            truth_state=[\"FF\", \"TF\", \"TT\"],\n            control_state=[\"in\", \"none\", \"out\"],\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n\nThe above control logic can be summarized as follows:\n\nIf the level is above the maximum, activate the control state “out”;\nIf the level is below the minimum, active the control state “in”;\nOtherwise activate the control state “none”.\n\nSetup the pump:\n\nmodel.pump.add(\n    Node(2, Point(1.0, 1.0)),\n    [pump.Static(control_state=[\"none\", \"in\", \"out\"], flow_rate=[0.0, 2e-3, 0.0])],\n)\nmodel.pump.add(\n    Node(3, Point(1.0, -1.0)),\n    [pump.Static(control_state=[\"none\", \"in\", \"out\"], flow_rate=[0.0, 0.0, 2e-3])],\n)\n\nThe pump data defines the following:\n\n\n\nControl state\nPump #2 flow rate (m/s)\nPump #3 flow rate (m/s)\n\n\n\n\n“none”\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n“in”\n2e-3\n0.0\n\n\n“out”\n0.0\n2e-3\n\n\n\nSetup the level boundary:\n\nmodel.level_boundary.add(\n    Node(4, Point(2.0, 0.0)), [level_boundary.Static(level=[10.0])]\n)\n\nSetup the rating curve:\n\nmodel.tabulated_rating_curve.add(\n    Node(5, Point(-1.0, 0.0)),\n    [tabulated_rating_curve.Static(level=[2.0, 15.0], flow_rate=[0.0, 2e-3])],\n)\n\nSetup the terminal:\n\nmodel.terminal.add(Node(6, Point(-2.0, 0.0)))\n\nSetup edges:\n\nmodel.edge.add(model.basin[1], model.pump[3])\nmodel.edge.add(model.pump[3], model.level_boundary[4])\nmodel.edge.add(model.level_boundary[4], model.pump[2])\nmodel.edge.add(model.pump[2], model.basin[1])\nmodel.edge.add(model.basin[1], model.tabulated_rating_curve[5])\nmodel.edge.add(model.tabulated_rating_curve[5], model.terminal[6])\nmodel.edge.add(model.discrete_control[7], model.pump[2])\nmodel.edge.add(model.discrete_control[7], model.pump[3])\n\nLet’s take a look at the model:\n\nmodel.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen edges are plotted with a dashed line since they are not present in the “Edge / static” schema but only in the “Control / condition” schema.\n\ndatadir = Path(\"data\")\nmodel.write(datadir / \"level_range/ribasim.toml\")\n\nPosixPath('data/level_range/ribasim.toml')\n\n\nNow run the model with ribasim level_range/ribasim.toml. After running the model, read back the results:\n\ndf_basin = pd.read_feather(datadir / \"level_range/results/basin.arrow\")\ndf_basin_wide = df_basin.pivot_table(\n    index=\"time\", columns=\"node_id\", values=[\"storage\", \"level\"]\n)\n\nax = df_basin_wide[\"level\"].plot()\n\ngreater_than = model.discrete_control.condition.df.greater_than\n\nax.hlines(\n    greater_than,\n    df_basin.time[0],\n    df_basin.time.max(),\n    lw=1,\n    ls=\"--\",\n    color=\"k\",\n)\n\nax.set_yticks(greater_than, [\"min\", \"max\"])\nax.set_ylabel(\"level\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that in January the level of the basin is too high and thus water is pumped out until the maximum level of the desired range is reached. Then until May water flows out of the basin freely through the tabulated rating curve until the minimum level is reached. From this point until the start of July water is pumped into the basin in short bursts to stay within the desired range. At the start of July rain starts falling on the basin, which causes the basin level to rise until the maximum level. From this point onward water is pumped out of the basin in short bursts to stay within the desired range.\n\n\n3 Model with PID control\nSet up the model:\n\nmodel = Model(starttime=\"2020-01-01\", endtime=\"2020-12-01\", crs=\"EPSG:4326\")\n\nSetup the basins:\n\nmodel.basin.add(\n    Node(2, Point(1.0, 0.0)),\n    [basin.Profile(area=[1000.0, 1000.0], level=[0.0, 1.0]), basin.State(level=[6.0])],\n)\n\nSetup the pump:\n\nmodel.pump.add(\n    Node(3, Point(2.0, 0.5)),\n    [pump.Static(flow_rate=[0.0])],  # Will be overwritten by PID controller\n)\n\nSetup the outlet:\n\nmodel.outlet.add(\n    Node(6, Point(2.0, -0.5)),\n    [outlet.Static(flow_rate=[0.0])],  # Will be overwritten by PID controller\n)\n\nSetup flow boundary:\n\nmodel.flow_boundary.add(\n    Node(1, Point(0.0, 0.0)),\n    [flow_boundary.Static(flow_rate=[1e-3])],\n)\n\nSetup level boundary:\n\nmodel.level_boundary.add(\n    Node(4, Point(3.0, 0.0)),\n    [level_boundary.Static(level=[5.0])],\n)\n\nSetup PID control:\n\nfor node, proportional, integral in [\n    (Node(5, Point(1.5, 1.0)), -1e-3, -1e-7),\n    (Node(7, Point(1.5, -1.0)), 1e-3, 1e-7),\n]:\n    pid_control_data = [\n        pid_control.Time(\n            time=[\n                \"2020-01-01\",\n                \"2020-05-01\",\n                \"2020-07-01\",\n                \"2020-12-01\",\n            ],\n            listen_node_id=2,\n            listen_node_type=\"Basin\",\n            target=[5.0, 5.0, 7.5, 7.5],\n            proportional=proportional,\n            integral=integral,\n            derivative=0.0,\n        )\n    ]\n    model.pid_control.add(node, pid_control_data)\n\nNote that the coefficients for the pump and the outlet are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

The Basin level is a piecewise linear function of time, with several stages explained below.\nConstants:\n\n\\(d\\): UserDemand #3 demand,\n\\(\\phi\\): Basin #2 precipitation rate,\n\\(q\\): LevelBoundary flow.\n\nStages:\n\nIn the first stage the Basin takes precedence so the UserDemand doesn’t abstract, hence the net change of Basin #2 is \\(q + \\phi\\);\nIn the second stage (and following stages) the Basin no longer has a positive demand, since precipitation provides enough water to get the Basin to its target level. The FlowBoundary flow gets fully allocated to the UserDemand, hence the net change of Basin #2 is \\(\\phi\\);\nIn the third stage the Basin enters its surplus stage, even though initially the level is below the maximum level. This is because the simulation anticipates that the current precipitation is going to bring the Basin level over its maximum level. The net change of Basin #2 is now \\(q + \\phi - d\\);\nAt the start of the fourth stage the precipitation stops, and so the UserDemand partly uses surplus water from the Basin to fulfill its demand. The net change of Basin #2 becomes \\(q - d\\).\nIn the final stage the Basin is in a dynamical equilibrium, since the Basin has no supply so the user abstracts precisely the flow from the LevelBoundary.\n\n\n\n6 Guidance of modelling a cascade of polder basins\nSituation description: This example shows how to make a model for a given practical water system, which consists of a cascade of level control polder basins with inlet and outlet to the main systems. Note that alternative model layouts are feasible for the same water system, each having its positive items and drawbacks.\n\nThe polder system is composed of a sequence of level controlled polder basins with weirs inbetween each basin and an inlet and outlet to main system\n\nmodel = Model(starttime=\"2020-01-01\", endtime=\"2021-01-01\", crs=\"EPSG:28992\")\n\nAll the polder basins are exposed to time varying forcings (precipitation, evaporation, drainage, infiltration) to mimic situations of water excess and water shortage.\nIn case of water excess, a pump in the most downstream polder will need to pump the surplus water to the main water system. In case of water shortage, an inlet at the most upstream polder will need to bring water into the cascase of polders. The main water system acts as a water source.\nModel approach: All polder basins as well as the main water system are modelled with basin nodes. To let the system experience all 4 excess/shortage situation, forcing time series are made in a way that is adapting to them. Overall, assume that in one year, the system will experience precipitation (situation 1) in winter and early spring, precipitation shortage (situation 2) from late spring until early autumn. During situation 2, polder basin 4 will experience additional seepage (compoensating its shortage), and later polder basin 3 will also receive more seepage.\nSetting up the basins:\n\ntime = pd.date_range(model.starttime, model.endtime)\nday_of_year = time.day_of_year.to_numpy()\n\nprecipitation = np.zeros(day_of_year.size)\nprecipitation[0:90] = 1.72e-8\nprecipitation[330:366] = 1.72e-8\n\nevaporation = np.zeros(day_of_year.size)\nevaporation[130:270] = 2.87e-8\n\ndrainage = np.zeros(day_of_year.size)\ndrainage[120:270] = 0.4 * 2.87e-8\ndrainage_3 = drainage.copy()\ndrainage_3[210:240] = 17 * 2.87e-8\ndrainage_4 = drainage.copy()\ndrainage_4[160:240] = 13 * 2.87e-8\n\ninfiltration = np.zeros(day_of_year.size)\ninfiltration[0:90] = 5e-8\n\npolder_profile = basin.Profile(area=[100, 100], level=[0.0, 3.0])\n\nbasin_time = [\n    basin.Time(\n        time=pd.date_range(model.starttime, model.endtime),\n        drainage=drainage,\n        potential_evaporation=evaporation,\n        infiltration=0.0,\n        precipitation=precipitation,\n        urban_runoff=0.0,\n    ),\n]\n\nbasin_time4 = [\n    basin.Time(\n        time=pd.date_range(model.starttime, model.endtime),\n        drainage=drainage_4,\n        potential_evaporation=evaporation,\n        infiltration=0.0,\n        precipitation=precipitation,\n        urban_runoff=0.0,\n    ),\n]\nbasin_time3 = [\n    basin.Time(\n        time=pd.date_range(model.starttime, model.endtime),\n        drainage=drainage_3,\n        potential_evaporation=evaporation,\n        infiltration=0.0,\n        precipitation=precipitation,\n        urban_runoff=0.0,\n    ),\n]\n\nmodel.basin.add(\n    Node(1, Point(2.0, 0.0)),\n    [\n        basin.State(level=[2.5]),\n        basin.Profile(area=[1000, 1000], level=[0.0, 3.0]),\n        basin.Time(\n            time=pd.date_range(model.starttime, model.endtime),\n            drainage=0.0,\n            potential_evaporation=0.0,\n            infiltration=0.0,\n            precipitation=0.0,\n            urban_runoff=0.0,\n        ),\n    ],\n)\nmodel.basin.add(\n    Node(4, Point(0.0, -2.0)),\n    [basin.State(level=[1.5]), polder_profile, *basin_time],\n)\nmodel.basin.add(\n    Node(6, Point(0.0, -4.0)),\n    [basin.State(level=[1.0]), polder_profile, *basin_time],\n)\nmodel.basin.add(\n    Node(8, Point(2.0, -4.0)),\n    [basin.State(level=[1.5]), polder_profile, *basin_time3],\n)\nmodel.basin.add(\n    Node(10, Point(4.0, -4.0)),\n    [basin.State(level=[1.3]), polder_profile, *basin_time4],\n)\nmodel.basin.add(\n    Node(12, Point(4.0, -2.0)),\n    [basin.State(level=[0.1]), polder_profile, *basin_time],\n)\n\nAfter all the basins are defined the connecting component inbetween the basins needs to be determined. For polder basin 5 (node 12), the water level needs to be maintain at 0.0 meter. This means that either there should be no water in this basin, or the basin bottom is lower than the reference level, and the water level should be maintained at the reference level.\nSince the water level of the main system is at 2.5 meter above the reference level a pump is needed to remove the water from polder basin 5.\nSetup the pumps:\n\nmodel.pump.add(\n    Node(13, Point(4.0, -1.0)),\n    [pump.Static(flow_rate=[0.5 / 3600])],\n)\n\nAccording to the description of situation 1 and 2, the water in one polder basin needs to be able to flow to the downstream basin if the current basin has too much water (i.e. the water level is above the setpoint) or if the downstream basin is below setpoint and needs more water. This could be modelled with an uncontrolled TabulatedRatingCurve node with Q=0 at the setpoint level (and Q rising when the level rises above setpoint) , or with an Outlet node where the minimum crest is specified at or just below the setpoint. In this example, we’ve chosen for the Outlet where we specify the minimum crest level 5 cm below the setpoint. For example: the Outlet of polder basin 1 (node 4) is specified with a minimum crest level of 1.95 meter.\nSetup the outlets:\n\n# Set up outlet\nmodel.outlet.add(\n    Node(2, Point(0.0, -1.0)),\n    [outlet.Static(flow_rate=[2 * 0.5 / 3600], min_crest_level=[0.0])],\n)\nmodel.outlet.add(\n    Node(5, Point(0.0, -3.0)),\n    [outlet.Static(flow_rate=[0.5 / 3600], min_crest_level=[1.95])],\n)\nmodel.outlet.add(\n    Node(7, Point(1.0, -4.0)),\n    [outlet.Static(flow_rate=[0.5 / 3600], min_crest_level=[1.45])],\n)\nmodel.outlet.add(\n    Node(9, Point(3.0, -4.0)),\n    [outlet.Static(flow_rate=[0.5 / 3600], min_crest_level=[0.95])],\n)\nmodel.outlet.add(\n    Node(11, Point(4.0, -3.0)),\n    [outlet.Static(flow_rate=[0.5 / 3600], min_crest_level=[0.45])],\n)\n\nWhen using Outlets as connecting nodes, the flow over the Outlet needs to be controlled to maintain the water level at the setpoint. For this purpose we introduce local PidControllers, where the targets of the PidControllers are set to the setpoints. Disadvantage of this local control approach is the delay that is introduced to transport the ‘basin X has a shortage’ message upstream through the cascade to the inlet.

    "text": "1 Set up the developer environment\nAfter you have installed the environment as described here you must still activate the QGIS plugins. The simplest way to do this is by running pixi run install-qgis-plugins. It grabs the latest version of the iMOD QGIS plugin and it makes a symlink to the ribasim_qgis folder so that QGIS can find it. It also installs plugins that make it possible to reload and debug your plugin while QGIS is open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn Windows you need to have Developer mode enabled. Otherwise you will not have enough access rights to create symlinks. For more info, see this Windows blog.\nWe wanted to implement this via pip install --editable, but QGIS doesn’t find the metadata.txt and therefore cannot load the plugin on startup.\n\n\n\n\n2 Running QGIS\nIn order to run QGIS with the plugins, simply call pixi run qgis. You will find the Ribasim and iMOD plugins in the tool bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn Windows, running QGIS from the start menu will disable Python, and thus the plugins. QGIS needs some more paths during the startup and the Pixi environment provides those.\n\n\n\n\n3 Running tests\nTo run the QGIS plugin tests in the application environment of QGIS, it is best to make use of the Docker environment provided in this repository. Make sure that docker is installed and available in your path.\nThen simply call pixi run test-ribasim-qgis.\n\n\n4 Debugging\nAfter installing the plugins via pixi run install-qgis-plugins. Extra debugging tools are also installed in QGIS that is installed within your pixi environment.\nAfter you have started pixi run qgis, you can make alterations to the Python code and use the Plugin Reloader to reload the plugin without restarting QGIS. The shortcut in QGIS is CTRL+F5.\nIt is also possible to connect the debugger of Visual Studio Code. For this the debugvs plugin is installed in QGIS. In QGIS press the button to Enable Debug for Visual Studio. Then go to Visual Studio Code and start the launch task Ribasim QGIS: Attach to QGIS. Now you can place breakpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are currently using debugvs 0.7 with ptvsd as service, since there is an open issue that breaks debugvs 0.8 with debugpy.",

If a new schema contains a priority column for allocation, it must also be added to the list of all such schemas in the function get_all_priorities in util.jl.\nvalidation.jl deals with checking and applying a specific sorting order for the tabular data (default is sorting by node ID only), see sort_by_function and sorted_table!.\nNow we define the function that is called in the second bullet above, in read.jl:\nfunction NewNodeType(db::DB, config::Config)::NewNodeType\n    static = load_structvector(db, config, NewNodeTypeStaticV1)\n    defaults = (; foo = 1, bar = false)\n    # Process potential control states in the static data\n    parsed_parameters, valid = parse_static_and_time(db, config, \"NewNodeType\"; static, defaults)\n\n    if !valid\n        error(\"Errors occurred when parsing NewNodeType data.\")\n    end\n\n    # Unpack the fields of static as inputs for the NewNodeType constructor\n    return NewNodeType(\n        NodeID.(NodeType.NewNodeType, parsed_parameters.node_id),\n        parsed_parameters.some_property,\n        parsed_parameters.control_mapping)\nend",

    "text": "1.3 Node behavior\nIn general if the new node type dictates flow, the behavior of the new node in the Ribasim core is defined in a method of the formulate_flow! function, which is called within the water_balance! (both in solve.jl) function being the right hand side of the system of differential equations solved by Ribasim. Here the details depend highly on the specifics of the node type. An example structure of a formulate_flow! method is given below.\nfunction formulate_flow!(new_node_type::NewNodeType, p::Parameters)::Nothing\n    # Retrieve relevant parameters\n    (; graph) = p\n    (; node_id, param_1, param_2) = new_node_type\n\n    # Loop over nodes of NewNodeType\n    for (i, id) in enumerate(node_id)\n        # compute e.g. flow based on param_1[i], param_2[i]\n    end\n\n    return nothing\nend\nIf the new node type is non-conservative, meaning it either adds or removes water from the model, these boundary flows also need to be recorded. This is done by storing it on the diagonal of the flow[from, to] matrix, e.g. flow[id, id] = q, where q is positive for water added to the model. Non-conservative node types need to be added to the nonconservative_nodetypes set such that this diagonal is set to a nonzero on creating the flow sparse matrix in the Connectivity constructor.",

    "text": "1.4 The Jacobian\nSee Equations for a mathematical description of the Jacobian.\nBefore the Julia core runs its simulation, the sparsity structure jac_prototype of \\(J\\) is determined with get_jac_prototype in sparsity.jl. This function runs trough all node types and looks for nodes that create dependencies between states. It creates a sparse matrix of zeros and ones, where the ones denote locations of possible non-zeros in \\(J\\). Note that only nodes that set flows in the physical layer (or have their own state like PidControl) affect the sparsity structure.\nWe divide the various node types in groups based on what type of state dependencies they yield, and these groups are discussed below. Each group has its own method update_jac_prototype! in utils.jl for the sparsity structure induced by nodes of that group. NewNodeType should be added to the signature of one these methods, or to the list of node types that do not contribute to the Jacobian in the method of update_jac_prototype! whose signature contains node::AbstractParameterNode. Of course it is also possible that a new method of update_jac_prototype! has to be introduced.\nThe current dependency groups are:\n\nOut-neighbor dependencies: examples are TabulatedRatingCurve, Pump (the latter only in the reduction factor regime and not PID controlled). If the in-neighbor of a node of this group is a basin, then the storage of this basin affects itself and the storage of the outneighbor (or the basin one node further if it is connected with a FractionalFlow in between) if that is also a basin;\nEither-neighbor dependencies: examples are LinearResistance, ManningResistance. If either the in-neighbor or out-neighbor of a node of this group is a basin, the storage of this basin depends on itself. If both the in-neighbor and the out-neighbor are basins, their storages also depend on eachother.\nThe PidControl node is a special case which is discussed in the PID equations.\n\nUsing jac_prototype the Jacobian of water_balance! is computed automatically using ForwardDiff.jl with memory management provided by PreallocationTools.jl. These computations make use of DiffCache and dual numbers.",

Ribasim allows users to model basins under current and changing conditions to evaluate and design and management of the water system. It is available as free and open source software under the MIT license. Besides a model simulation core, Ribasim also includes tooling to assist in building models from basic datasets and visualize results. The model and its results provides insights to decision makers, enabling them to build consensus amongst water users and make informed decisions about how to manage water resources optimally.\nThe model concept of Ribasim is composed of multiple layers: - a physical layer representing water bodies and associated infrastructure as well as abstractions, - a rule-based control layer to manage the infrastructure, and - (optionally) a priority-based allocation layer to take centralized decisions on user abstractions. - (optionally) a coupling layer to exchange fluxes and heads with other kernels\nTypically hydrological processes on land will be represented in detail by other models which can be coupled (online) to Ribasim with the help of iMOD Coupler. Currently, an online coupling with MODFLOW 6 (groundwater) and with Metaswap + MODFLOW 6 (unsaturated zone + groundwater) is available. The corresponding documentation can be found within the iMOD Suite Documentation.\nThis version of Ribasim is the follow up of the legacy Fortran kernel of Ribasim (version 7) applied world wide, the Fortran kernel SIMRES applied in the Netherlands, and the surface water models Distribution Model and Mozart of the Dutch National Hydrological Instrument.",

In Ribasim, we make use of DifferentialEquations.jl and its ODE solvers. Many of these solvers are based on adaptive time stepping, which means the solver will decide how large the time steps can be depending on the state of the system.\nThe forcing, like precipitation, is generally provided as a time series. Ribasim is set up to support unevenly spaced timeseries. The solver will stop on timestamps where new forcing values are available, so they can be loaded as the new value.\nRibasim is essentially a continuous model, rather than daily or hourly. If you want to use hourly forcing, you only need to make sure that your forcing data contains hourly updates. The output frequency can be configured independently. To be able to write a closed water balance, we accumulate the fluxes. This way any variations in between timesteps are also included, and we can output in m³ rather than m³s⁻¹.",

Besides modelling a single lumped watershed, it allows you to divide the area into a network of connected representative elementary watersheds (REWs) (Reggiani, Sivapalan, and Majid Hassanizadeh 1998). At this scale global water balance laws can be formulated by means of integration of point-scale conservation equations over control volumes. Such an approach makes Ribasim a semi-distributed model. In this document we typically use the term “basin” to refer to the REW. Each basin has an associated polygon, and the set of basins is connected to each other as described by a graph, which we call the network. Below is a representation of both on the map.\n\n\n\nMozart Local Surface Water polygons and their drainage.\n\n\nThe network is described as graph. Flow can be bi-directional, and the graph does not have to be acyclic.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    A[\"basin A\"] --- B[\"basin B\"];\n    A --- C[\"basin C\"];\n    B --- D[\"basin D\"];\n    C --- D;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternally a directed graph is used. The direction is defined to be the positive flow direction, and is generally set in the dominant flow direction. The basins are the nodes of the network graph. Basin states and properties such storage volume and wetted area are associated with the nodes (A, B, C, D), as are most forcing data such as precipitation, evaporation, or water demand. Basin connection properties and interbasin flows are associated with the edges (the lines between A, B, C, and D) instead.\nMultiple basins may exist within the same spatial polygon, representing different aspects of the surface water system (perennial ditches, ephemeral ditches, or even surface ponding). Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 show the 25.0 m rasterized primary, secondary, and tertiary surface waters as identified by BRT TOP10NL (PDOK 2022) in the Hupsel basin. These systems may represented in multiple ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hupsel: primary surface water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Hupsel: secondary surface water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hupsel: tertiary surface water.\n\n\n\nAs a single basin (A) containing all surface water, discharging to its downstream basin to the west (B):\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    A[\"basin A\"] --&gt; B[\"basin B\"];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a system may be capable of representing discharge, but it cannot represent residence times or differences in solute concentrations: within a single basin, a drop of water is mixed instantaneously. Instead, we may the group primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T) surface waters. Then T may flow into S, S into P, and P discharges to the downstream basin (B.)\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    T[\"basin T\"] --&gt; S[\"basin S\"];\n    S --&gt; P[\"basin P\"];\n    P --&gt; B[\"basin B\"];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs each (sub)basin has its own volume, low throughput (high volume, low discharge, long residence time) and high throughput (low volume, high discharge, short residence time) systems can be represented in a lumped manner; of course, more detail requires more parameters.",

Node type typically used for gravity flow conditions either free flowing open water channels or over a fixed structure.\nLinearResistance: bi-directional flow based on head difference and linear resistance. Node type typically used for bi-directional flow situations or situations where head difference over a structure determines its actual flow capacity.\nManningResistance: bi-directional flow based on head difference and resistance using Manning-Gauckler formula. Same usage as LinearResistance, providing a better hydrological meaning to the resistance parameterization.\nPump: one-directional structure with a set flow rate. Node type typically used in combination with control to force water over the edge.\nOutlet: one-directional gravity structure with a set flow rate. Node type typically used in combination with control to force water over the edge, even if their is a mismatch in actual hydraulic capacity. The node type has an automated mechanism to stop the flow when the head difference is zero.\nFractionalFlow: to split an outflow over multiple edges based on a flow fraction. Node type is typically used for diversions or bifurcations with a known and fixed ratio.\n\nThe control layer can activate or deactivate nodes, set flow rates for the Pump and Outlet, or choose different parameterizations for TabulatedRatingCurve, LinearResistance, ManningResistance or FractionalFlow.\nConnector nodes are required within a Ribasim network to determine the flow exchange between basins.",

To keep a proper functioning allocation concept under these circumstances, the modeller can decompose the network domain into a main network and multiple sub-networks. The allocation will then be conducted in three steps:\n\nconduct an inventory of demands from the sub-networks to inlets from the main network,\nallocate the available water in the main network to the subnetworks inlets,\nallocate the assigned water within each subnetwork to the individual demand nodes.\n\nThe demand nodes then will request this updated demand from the rule-based simulation. Whether this updated demand is indeed abstracted depends on all dry-fall control mechanism implemented in the rule-based simulation.\nThe following sequence diagram illustrates this calculation process within then allocation phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant boundary\nparticipant basin\nparticipant user_demand\nparticipant allocation_subNetwork\nparticipant allocation_mainNetwork\n\nuser_demand-&gt;&gt;allocation_subNetwork: demand\nloop\n   allocation_subNetwork--&gt;&gt;allocation_mainNetwork: demand inventory at inlets\nend\nuser_demand-&gt;&gt;allocation_mainNetwork: demand\nboundary-&gt;&gt;allocation_mainNetwork: source availability\nbasin-&gt;&gt;allocation_mainNetwork: source availability\nallocation_mainNetwork--&gt;&gt;allocation_mainNetwork: allocate to inlets (and user_demands)\nallocation_mainNetwork-&gt;&gt;user_demand: allocated\nallocation_mainNetwork-&gt;&gt;allocation_subNetwork: allocated\nloop\n   allocation_subNetwork--&gt;&gt;allocation_subNetwork: allocate to user_demands\nend\nallocation_subNetwork-&gt;&gt;user_demand: allocated\nuser_demand-&gt;&gt;basin: abstracted",

The complexity arises from the fact that \\(Q_\\text{PID}\\) is a contribution to \\(\\frac{\\text{d}u_\\text{PID}}{\\text{d}t} = f_\\text{PID}\\), which makes Equation 2 an implicit equation for \\(Q_\\text{PID}\\). We define\n\\[\nf_\\text{PID} = \\hat{f}_\\text{PID} \\pm Q_\\text{pump/outlet},\n\\]\nthat is, \\(\\hat{f}_\\text{PID}\\) is the right hand side of the ODE for the controlled basin storage state without the contribution of the PID controlled pump. The plus sign holds for an outlet and the minus sign for a pump, dictated by the way the pump and outlet connectivity to the controlled basin is enforced.\nUsing this, solving Equation 2 for \\(Q_\\text{PID}\\) yields \\[\nQ_\\text{pump/outlet} = \\text{clamp}\\left(\\phi(u_\\text{us})\\frac{K_pe + K_iI + K_d \\left(\\frac{\\text{d}\\text{SP}}{\\text{d}t}-\\frac{\\hat{f}_\\text{PID}}{A(u_\\text{PID})}\\right)}{1\\pm\\phi(u_\\text{us})\\frac{K_d}{A(u_\\text{PID})}}, Q_{\\min}, Q_{\\max}\\right),\n\\]\nwhere the clamping is again done last.

This is then converted into a string of “T” for true and “F” for false. This string we call the truth state.*\nThe table below determines for the given DiscreteControl node ID and truth state what the corresponding control state is.\nFor all the nodes this DiscreteControl node affects (as given by the “control” edges in Edges / static), their parameters are set to those parameters in NodeType / static corresponding to the determined control state.\n\n*. There is also a second truth state created in which for the last condition that changed it is specified whether it was an upcrossing (“U”) or downcrossing (“D”) of the threshold (greater than) value. If a control state is specified for a truth state that is crossing-specific, this takes precedence over the control state for the truth state that contains only “T” and “F”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen creating truth states, it is important to not use the order of the condition table as you provide it, but the order as it is written to the file.
